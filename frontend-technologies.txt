Frontend technology focuses on creating the visual and interactive parts of a website that users directly interact with. It is built mainly using HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for interactivity. Modern tools and frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, Bootstrap, and Tailwind make development faster and more efficient. The goal of frontend development is to build responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing web interfaces that work smoothly across all devices.
